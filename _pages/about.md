Hi, I'm Alexander! I'm in my final year at the University of Maryland, where I study Computer Science and Mathematics. When I began programming in 2016, I quickly found my passion in creating applications that were both functional, beautiful, and mathematically interesting. 

One of the first projects like this was a cellular automaton, where I simulated evolution by having "cells" evolve the perfect tradeoff between traits like speed, size, and strength in order to survive and defeat competition. Somehow, I managed to find the algorithm that combined these traits to create my ideal evolution simulator. The result was a program that was visually stunning, yet highly chaotic and unique. Unfortunately, I did not know how to use git at that time, and eventually lost all of my code. Attempts to recreate the program have continually been unsuccessful, however I am confident that one day I will rediscover the formula.

I have been working with and studying AI since 2017, when my attempts to create increasingly beautiful applications were stunted by my lack of artistic talent. This led me to conclude that the only reasonable path forward was to dedicate my career to developing AI that make art for me. Focusing on AI also allowed me to continue developing my math skills, experiment with new technology, and most importantly, solve problems that I found interesting. 

One of my very first ideas was to create AI that could procedurally generate realistic terrain. Unfortunately, doing this well enough to satisfy me was impossible at the time, due to the computational power required and the relative immaturity of generative models. Thankfully, I am now fortunate enough to have access to a single RTX 3090 Ti, which, in combination with significant advancements in generative models, has allowed me to make measurable progress on this project. In fact, diffusion models in particular are so well suited for this task, I believe it is now only a matter of time before this technique creates the world's best procedurally generated terrain! I have created this website to document my progress, and to share my learnings with others who may be interested.

Currently, Iâ€™m interning at the Collaborative Institute for Satellite Earth System Studies (CISESS), where I contribute to research focused on climate and atmospheric studies. In addition to my internship, I previously worked at Walmart Global Tech, where I was part of the site reliability team, developing large language model services.
